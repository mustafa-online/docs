## <Heading hidden>Introduction</Heading>

By default when you install Laravel Shopper for the first time you configure and create your shop, and this allows you to create a first location which will have the information you defined. This is the initial location in which all products will be stored.

If you have already used Shopify it is a bit the same model, but a little simpler so that you can modify it because the system is accessible for any type of business.

You can set up multiple locations in your store so that you can track inventory and have excel documents of the products ordered in each of your locations. Your locations can be retail stores, warehouses, popups, or any other place where you manage or store inventory. With multiple locations, you have better visibility into your inventory in your business.
