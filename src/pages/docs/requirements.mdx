Shopper is a modern PHP application, built as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) package, and has the same server requirements as — you guessed it.

Shopper has a few requirements you should be aware of before installing.

## Server Requirements

Make sure your server meets the following requirements.

* PHP >= 7.4+
* MySQL Server 8.0+ , Mariadb 10.3.2+ or PostgreSQL
* Composer
* Json PHP Extension

## Recommended Hosts

We recommend using [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) to host most Shopper sites. Their servers are fast, inexpensive, and we use them ourselves. Full disclosure: that’s an affiliate link but we wouldn’t recommend them if it wasn’t an excellent option.


## Development Environments

All of these requirements are satisfied by the [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead) virtual machine, which makes it a great local Laravel development environment. Virtual machines aren’t for everybody though, so here are a couple of other options.


### MacOS & Linux

[Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) is a development environment for Mac minimalists, If you are on Linux you must use this [version](https://cpriego.github.io/valet-linux/) of Valet for Linux. No Vagrant, No Apache, No Nginx, No need to manually edit hosts file. It simply maps all the subdirectories in a “web” directory (such as ~/Sites) to .test or .localhost domains.

You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. We use it ourselves and it’s brilliant.


### Windows

[Laragon](https://laragon.org) and [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com) are both good choice for those of the Windows persuasion.
