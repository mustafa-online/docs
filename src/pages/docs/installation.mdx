import { Heading } from '@/components/Heading'

## <Heading number="1">Install Shopper via composer</Heading>

Shopper is realy easy to install. After creating your new Laravel application \(7+\) you can include the Shopper package with the following command:

```bash
composer require shopper/framework
```

## <Heading number="2">Write Env Variables</Heading>

Next make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file, you will also want to add your application URL in the `APP_URL` variable:

```php
APP_URL=http://laravelshopper.test
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

## <Heading number="3">Automatic Installation</Heading>

To install Shopper run this command in your project.

```bash
php artisan shopper:install
```

This will install shopper, publish vendor files, create shopper and storage symlinks if they don't exist in the public folder, run migrations and seeders classes.


And we're all good to go!


## <Heading number="4">Create an Admin user</Heading>

Now we can create a new super user and sign into the Dashboard and start creating some content to display on the frontend.

Run the following command to create a user with supreme \(at the moment of creation\) rights:

```bash
php artisan shopper:admin
```

And you will be prompted for the users username, firstname, lastname and password.

## <Heading number="5">Publish Vendor Files</Heading>

If you want to publish again Shopper's vendor files run these commands:

```bash
php artisan shopper:publish
```

## <Heading number="5">Update Existing Files</Heading>

Extend your current User Model \(usually `app/User.php`\) using the `Shopper\Framework\Models\User\User as ShopperUser` alias:

```php
<?php

use Shopper\Framework\Models\User\User as ShopperUser; 

class User extends ShopperUser
{
    // ...
}
```

To run the project you may use the built-in server: `php artisan serve`

After that, run `composer dump-autoload` to finish your installation!

To view Shopper's dashboard go to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/console
```

If your are using Laravel Valet you can easily access with your project name with `.test` at the end when you navigate on you project.

```bash
http://laravelshopper.test/console
```
