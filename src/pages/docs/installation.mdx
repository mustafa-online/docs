## <Heading number="1">Install Shopper via composer</Heading>

Shopper is realy easy to install. After creating your new Laravel application \(5.6+\) you can include the Shopper package with the following command:

```bash
composer require mckenziearts/shopper
```

## <Heading number="2">Write Env Variables</Heading>

Next make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file, you will also want to add your application URL in the `APP_URL` variable:

```php
APP_URL=http://laravelshopper.test
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

## <Heading number="3">Automatic Installation</Heading>

To install Shopper run this command in your project.

```bash
php artisan shopper:install
```

This will install shopper, publish vendor files, create shopper and storage symlinks if they don't exist in the public folder, run migrations and seeders classes.

<Warning message="If you see this error message you have an outdated version of MySQL, use the following solution" link="https://laravel-news.com/laravel-5-4-key-too-long-error" linkMessage="Laravel 5.4 Key too long error" />


And we're all good to go!


## <Heading number="4">Create an Admin user</Heading>

Now we can create a new super user and sign into the Dashboard and start creating some content to display on the frontend.

Run the following command to create a user with supreme \(at the moment of creation\) rights:

```bash
php artisan shopper:admin
```

And you will be prompted for the users username, firstname, lastname and password.

## <Heading number="5">Publish Vendor Files</Heading>

If you want to publish again Shopper's vendor files run these commands:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mckenziearts\Shopper\ShopperServiceProvider"

// or 

php artisan vendor:publish --all
```

## <Heading number="5">Update Existing Files</Heading>

Extend your current User Model \(usually `app/User.php`\) using the `Mckenziearts\Shopper\Plugins\Users\Models\User as ShopperUser` alias:

```php
<?php

use Mckenziearts\Shopper\Plugins\Users\Models\User as ShopperUser; 

class User extends ShopperUser
{
    // ...
}
```

To run the project you may use the built-in server: `php artisan serve`

After that, run `composer dump-autoload` to finish your installation!

To view Shopper's dashboard go to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/console
```

If your are using Laravel Valet you can easily access with your project name with `.test` at the end when you navigation on you project.

```bash
http://laravelshopper.test/console
```
