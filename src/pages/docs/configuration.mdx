With the installation of Shopper you will find new configurations files located at the shopper folder under config folder `shopper/auth.php`, `shopper/routes.php`, and `shopper/system.php`.  

And the `system.php` file is main for platform, you can find various options to change the configuration of your Shopper installation.

<Info message="If you cache your configuration files please make sure to run `php artisan config:clear` after you changed something" />

## System

All the basic configurations for using shopper can be found in this file. The management of the locale, the models to use and additional resources (scripts and styles) to the administration.

**Additional resources**

```php
<?php

'resources' => [
    'stylesheets' => [
        //'css/custom.css',
    ],
    'scripts'     => [
        //'js/custom.css',
    ],
],
```

During your work you may need to add your own style tables or javascript scenarios globally for all the pages, so you need to add them to relevant arrays.


## Routes

The configuration of the routes allows you to specify a prefix to access your dashboard, the addition of middleware and the configuration file to add more routes to your administration.

**Dashboard prefix**

```php
<?php

'prefix' => env('SHOPPER_DASHBOARD_PREFIX', 'shopper'),
```

The system installed on the website can be easily defined by the dashboard prefix, for example it is `wp-admin` for WordPress, and it gives an opportunity to automatically search for old vulnerable versions of software and gain control over it.

There are other reasons but we won't speak of them in this section. The point is that Shopper allows to change dashboard prefix to every other name, `admin` or `administrator` for example.

**Middleware**

```php
<?php

'middleware' => [],
```

Shopper gives you the ability to add middleware to all of your routes. These middlewares will be applied to all the routes of your administration.


**Additional dashboard routes**

```php
<?php

// Eg.: base_path('routes/shopper.php')


'custom_file' => null,
```

By default none of your routes in the `web.php` file will be accessible and loaded in the shopper administration. So that your routes added in the sidebar can have the middleware applied to the dashboard, you must fill in an additional routing file and this will be automatically loaded by Shopper's internal RouteServiceProvider
