import { Info } from '@/components/Alert'

With the installation of Shopper you will find new configurations files located at the `shopper` folder under laravel config folder `auth.php`, `mails.php`, `routes.php`, and `system.php`.  

And the `system.php` file is main for platform, you can find various options to change the configuration of your Shopper installation.

<Info message="If you cache your configuration files please make sure to run `php artisan config:clear` after you changed something" />

## System

All the basic configurations for using shopper can be found in this file. The management of the locale, the models to use and additional resources (scripts and styles) to the administration. All these configuration can be find in the `config/shopper/system.php` file.

**Controllers**

By default Shopper loads controllers that are defined in this namespace. You can change it if you have a different structure. These controllers are used to extend and add functionality in the administration

In your config file you have the controllers key that define the controller's namespace for your extended Controllers:

```php

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Shopper Controllers config
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | If you want extends your shopper admin panel with great features,
    | Here you can specify custom Controller Namespace and Shopper
    | RouteServiceProvider will load all your controllers.
    |
    */

    'controllers' => [

        'namespace' => 'App\\Http\\Controllers\\Shopper',

    ],


```

**Models**

By default the models used are defined in the models key, if you want to use your own models you can replace them here.

```php

    'models' => [

        /**
         * Eloquent model should be used to retrieve your brands. Of course,
         * it is often just the "Brand" model but you may use whatever you like.
         *
         * The model you want to use as a Brand model needs to extends the
         * `\Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Brand` model.
         */

        'brand' => \Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Brand::class,

        /**
         * Eloquent model should be used to retrieve your categories. Of course,
         * it is often just the "Category" model but you may use whatever you like.
         *
         * The model you want to use as a Category model needs to extends the
         * `\Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Category` model.
         */

        'category'  => \Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Category::class,

        /**
         * Eloquent model should be used to retrieve your collections. Of course,
         * it is often just the "Collection" model but you may use whatever you like.
         *
         * The model you want to use as a Collection model needs to extends the
         * `\Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Collection` model.
         */

        'collection'  => \Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Collection::class,

        /**
         * Eloquent model should be used to retrieve your products. Of course,
         * it is often just the "Product" model but you may use whatever you like.
         *
         * The model you want to use as a Product model needs to extends the
         * `\Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Product` model.
         */

        'product'  => \Shopper\Framework\Models\Shop\Product\Product::class,

    ],

```


**Additional resources**

```php

<?php


'resources' => [
    'stylesheets' => [
        //'css/custom.css',
    ],
    'scripts'     => [
        //'js/custom.css',
    ],
],

```

During your work you may need to add your own style tables or javascript scenarios globally for all the pages, so you need to add them to relevant arrays.


## Routes

The configuration of the routes allows you to specify a prefix to access your dashboard, the addition of middleware and the configuration file to add more routes to your administration.

**Dashboard prefix**

```php

<?php

'prefix' => env('SHOPPER_DASHBOARD_PREFIX', 'shopper'),

```

The system installed on the website can be easily defined by the dashboard prefix, for example it is `wp-admin` for WordPress, and it gives an opportunity to automatically search for old vulnerable versions of software and gain control over it.

There are other reasons but we won't speak of them in this section. The point is that Shopper allows to change dashboard prefix to every other name, `admin` or `administrator` for example.

**Middleware**

```php

<?php

'middleware' => [],

```

Shopper gives you the ability to add middleware to all of your routes. These middlewares will be applied to all the routes of your administration.


**Additional dashboard routes**

```php

<?php

// Eg.: base_path('routes/shopper.php')

'custom_file' => null,

```

By default none of your routes in the `web.php` file will be accessible and loaded in the shopper administration. So that your routes added in the sidebar can have the middleware applied to the dashboard, you must fill in an additional routing file and this will be automatically loaded by Shopper's internal RouteServiceProvider


### Mapbox

Shopper uses Mapbox to enter the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of your store so that you can easily tell your customers your location.
The mapbox component to use is that of [Blade UI Kit](https://blade-ui-kit.com/docs/0.x/mapbox) and to activate the map you can just follow the documentation on this part.

## Update Configurations

In your `config/filesystems.php` config file add the following to the disks and links section:

```php

'disks' => [
    ...

    /** Shopper Uploads Disks. */
    'avatars' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => storage_path('app/avatars'),
        'url' => env('APP_URL').'/avatars',
        'visibility' => 'public',
    ],

    'uploads' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => storage_path('app/uploads'),
        'url' => env('APP_URL').'/uploads',
        'visibility' => 'public',
    ],

],

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Symbolic Links
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here you may configure the symbolic links that will be created when the
| `storage:link` Artisan command is executed. The array keys should be
| the locations of the links and the values should be their targets.
|
*/

'links' => [
    ...
    
    public_path('avatars') => storage_path('app/avatars'),
    public_path('uploads') => storage_path('app/uploads'),
],

```

**Create New Folders**

After adding the 2 entries in the filesystem config file, you must create them and add them to the .gitignore file.
In your storage directory create 2 new folders called `avatars` and `uploads`.

```shell
mkdir storage/app/avatars && mkdir storage/app/uploads
```

In each new folder that you have created (avatars and uploads) you must create a .gitignore file which will contain the following line

```shell
*
!.gitignore
```
